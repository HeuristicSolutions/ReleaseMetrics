Contingency Points
---------------------------
Unused contingency points ARE NOT counted towards "shipped points". We decided that they should only be counted if they 
are used to cover a specifically identified scope change or new requirement. If we can't allocate those points to a specific 
piece of work that we did, that was not originally planned for, then they remain "unused".

In some cases, this may correlate with "getting done quicker than planned", in which there should be some other (unplanned)
work that we did instead. This may be other stories we pulled in, additional IA Support, whatever. In this case we don't count
the unused contingency because we ARE counting this other work which should offset it.

In other cases, the planned epic may have taken the entire allocated calendar period (based on the full point total including
contingency) but the contingency points may remain unused. This could happen if the additional complexity the contingency was
allocated to offset manifested as across-the-board-things-took-longer-than-planned and not a specific scope change we could
point to. In this case, we don't count the unusued contingency and there WON'T be any other work to offset it. We agreed that
this will show up negatively in "the numbers", because the cost/pt will go up, but that we'll need to rely on human analysis 
to explain this. (As long as we delivered the promised work within the promised schedule then the individual epic should be
considered a success, even if the hours per point spikes up)





TODO: Figure out how to handle stuff like LB-503, which is work related to the current release that was billed to defect res
